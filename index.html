<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.
The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect. -->

<html lang="en">
  <!-- The <html> tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document. -->

  <head>
    <!-- The <head> element can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more. -->
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <!-- <meta> tags are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. -->
    <meta name="author" content="Danylo Veselyi" />
    <meta
      name="description"
      content="This website is just an excercise to practice the basic html structure"
    />
    <title>Basic Structure Practice</title>
    <!-- The <title> tag is required in all HTML documents and it defines the title of the document. -->
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. -->
    <h1 title="h1">This is the best important heading</h1>
    <!-- The <h1> to <h6> tags are used to define HTML headings. <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading. -->

    <!-- The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element. -->

    <h2 title="h2">This heading is a little less importent</h2>

    <h3 title="h3">This heading is even less importent than the one above</h3>
